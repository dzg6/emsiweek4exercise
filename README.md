# Emsi Week 4 Exercise

Created by Mark Reynolds

## Concept:
To create a local python server/api that collects fruit and vegetable excel files, reads the files, and serves the new produce with prices as a JSON object to the original HTML exercise. I have also added some react to the bottom of index.html to test the api scripts.
 
Before running and testing the api, check out the data/fruits folder. You will notice there are only 3 excel sheets. Watch this folder after you click the download excel button.
 
This was my first time writing and building in python and picked up quite a bit for this first exercise.
